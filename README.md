## History

Frogger is a classic arcade game that was developed in 1981 by Konami and was distributed by Sega. It is one of the most recognizable classic arcade games of the 80's, which was considered as the golden age of the arcade games.

The purpose of the original game was to direct the frogs to their homes, through a busy road and a hazardous river. Throughout the years, various clones of Frogger were developed, for almost every available platform and operating system. 

Worth mentioning also, is the characteristic music of the game, which is still recognizable after all these years.

Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
